                            <p>Atchai came up with a technical approach which has proven to offer huge efficiencies in the
production of TV channel support websites. We now have an underlying architecture which enables quick and efficient rollout of new websites, along with the tools to ensure that every site we produce is accessible across mobile devices.</p>
                            <p>Atchai were extremely professional, patient, and showed a great understanding of our often changing requirements and priorities. Their Agile approach to development, along with regular and effective communication allowed us to accommodate change and react quickly to evolving business and user requirements.</p>
                            <p>I&#8217;d highly recommend Atchai and wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to work with them again.</p>
