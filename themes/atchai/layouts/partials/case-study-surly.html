                <p>Slack has rapidly become the most loved platform for enterprise messaging and collaboration.  It's 3 million daily active users spend an average of 140 minutes on Slack every work day.   </p><br>

                <p>Within our own Slack team we found ourselves sharing a lot of links and then struggling to find them after a few weeks of messages had piled up on top.  The Slack search can work, if you know exactly what text was in, or around the link.  We wanted a simple way to keep track of all the links that we had shared in one place, so we built Sur.ly - a Slack bot that will sit in your channel and copy any links that are shared to a Google Doc the whole team can access. </p><br>
                
                    <p>We used the excellent node.js botkit library, which provides both slack integration and facebook messenger integration - for more details see our blog post <a href="2016-07-01-develop-multi-team-slack-bots">Multi-team slack bots hosted with Beepboop</a>.</p>
