                <p>Life is busy and getting busier. Sometimes technology is the problem causing all kinds of distractions, but it can also be your friend. mindBot is a chatbot that uses introspective questioning and AI to help you organize your mind and concentrate on doing what matters most to you.</p><br>

                <p>Initially developed as a Slack Application, Atchai have been engaged to take the Mindbot concept to every mobile device on the planet, integrating with <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio's</a> SMS service.  Working in short sprints, we have suceeded in getting an MVP to market within 2 weeks, allowing us to start learning about user needs and continually iterate on the product.</p><br>

                <p>Have you ever wanted to capture a free flow of thoughts and ideas without having to unlock your phone, open a notes app and type them out? We developed echoNote as part of a quantified self project for <a href="http://joylab.co.uk/">Joylab</a> - the digital innovation agency. </p><br>

                <p>Amazon Echo is a device that is always on, listening and responding to any command you give. From the comfort of your living room, you can just speak your ideas out loud and echoNote will transcribe them for you.</p><br>
                
                <p>We used the <a href="https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js">Alexa Skills Kit</a> Node.js library to build a custom skill that can listen to listen to your ideas and store the text in a Google Spreadsheet along with a timestamp.  The code we've written has been open sourced and is available on Github. </p>

                <p>Slack has rapidly become the most loved platform for enterprise messaging and collaboration.  It's 3 million daily active users spend an average of 140 minutes on Slack every work day.</p><br>

                <p>Within our own Slack team we found ourselves sharing a lot of links and then struggling to find them after a few weeks of messages had piled up on top.  The Slack search can work, if you know exactly what text was in, or around the link.  We wanted a simple way to keep track of all the links that we had shared in one place, so we built Sur.ly - a Slack bot that will sit in your channel and copy any links that are shared to a Google Doc the whole team can access.</p><br>
                
                    <p>We used the excellent node.js botkit library, which provides both slack integration and facebook messenger integration - for more details see our blog post <a href="2016-07-01-develop-multi-team-slack-bots">Multi-team slack bots hosted with Beepboop</a>.</p>
