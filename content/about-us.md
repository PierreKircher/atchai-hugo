Atchai is a digital consultancy and development house specialising in open source data-driven applications. 

Our work is driven by new technology, user centred design and [Agile methodologies](about-us/how-we-work) to deliver consistently great results. What makes us different is the team we work with; all our people are experts in their field and have world-class credentials to back it up. We think creatively about technology and implement it strategically. We invest in new and interesting ideas and regularly release open-source code to the community. Our recent clients include the Bank of England, UEFA, NHS National Innovation Centre, Turner Broadcasting, Internews, and Mencap, along with a number of smaller organisations whom we love just as much.
