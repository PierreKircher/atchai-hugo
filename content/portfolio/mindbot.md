Life is busy and getting busier. Sometimes technology is the problem causing all kinds of distractions, but it can also be your friend. mindBot is a chatbot that uses introspective questioning and AI to help you organize your mind and concentrate on doing what matters most to you.

Initially developed as a Slack Application, Atchai have been engaged to take the Mindbot concept to every mobile device on the planet, integrating with <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio's</a> SMS service.  Working in short sprints, we have suceeded in getting an MVP to market within 2 weeks, allowing us to start learning about user needs and continually iterate on the product.
